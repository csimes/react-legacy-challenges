### Objectives

There were four challenges in this project which focused on different portions of React Legacy code and logic application, escalating in difficulty.

- The Cats Challenge was a debug challenge,
- The Search Challenge included some debugging but focused primarily on writing logic,
- The Dogs Challenge focused on fetching and displaying data in React,
- The ToDo Challenge is an opportunity to apply everything learned to date by creating a simple to do list.
